## Problem Statement
Public speaking is a tough thing that a lot of people struggle with. There are a lot of reasons why it can be so hard, like being nervous, not being confident, or having trouble organizing your thoughts. It takes a lot of practice and hard work to become a good public speaker. Even experienced speakers still have to work on things like articulation, tone modulation, and audience engagement.

A speech improvement device can be a valuable tool in the journey to becoming a better public speaker. These devices can give you real-time feedback on things like your pace, pitch, and clarity. This feedback can help you identify areas where you need to improve and make the necessary changes to become a more confident and compelling communicator.

## Project Objectives
A wearable device to analyze the audience's body language and facial emotions during a presentation or a public speaking event. This determines important sentiments such as boredom, restlessness, happiness, etc. It has the ability to record the speaker's words in real-time and analyzes overall speaker performance, providing real-time feedback on their tonality and pace of the speech. In addition, the device is capable of providing various reminders such as an estimated duration of how long they have left based on their script or the number of slides left to present.

After the speech/presentation is finished, the user will be able to view which part of his speech or what they have said has the best engagement with the audience in an intuitive dashboard.
